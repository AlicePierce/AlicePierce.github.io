## About Me
I am from the vibrant and coastal city of Mazatlán, México. I moved to the United States to pursue my undergraduate studies at UC Davis, where I majored in Biotechnology with an emphasis on plants. 

During my time at UC Davis, I worked in Dr. Alan Rose's lab, where I studied how stimulatory introns influence gene expression in plants. This experience sparked my love for introns, non-coding sequences, and their intricate roles in gene regulation. 

After completing my undergraduate degree, I joined Dr. Maeli Melotto's lab, where I explored the spatio-temporal localization of JAZ4 in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. JAZ4's function is modulated by alternative splicing, which further deepened my interest in gene regulation.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Dr. Grey Monroe's lab, where I study how introns affect chromatin biology in plants. My research is driven by a desire to understand the broader implications of non-coding sequences on chromatin structure and gene expression, contributing to our knowledge of plant biology and epigenomics.

I am deeply committed to fostering equitable and accessible spaces in STEM. As a Mexican immigrant and the first person in my family to pursue a doctoral degree, I have faced significant barriers on my journey to higher education, which has only strengthened my resolve to support historically underrepresented groups in science. I actively engage in mentorship and outreach programs to inspire and guide the next generation of diverse scientists.

Currently, I serve as the president of the graduate student and postdoctoral chapter of SACNAS at UC Davis, where we lead outreach and community-building efforts across all levels of education, from K-8 and high school to community college and undergraduate students. Our mission is to increase representation in STEM through targeted mentorship and hands-on activities.

Additionally, I am the program coordinator for EnvironMentors, a national college access program that pairs high school students with graduate student mentors to guide them through independent research projects and college preparation.
