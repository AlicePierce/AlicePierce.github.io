            Iâ€™m a passionate plant biologist and science communicator. Originally from the vibrant coastal city of MazatlÃ¡n, MÃ©xico, 
            Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the diverse plant life that surrounded me growing up. This early fascination led me to 
            pursue a career in plant biology. Currently, Iâ€™m studying how introns influence chromatin biology in plants as part of 
            Grey Monroeâ€™s lab at UC Davis.

        <h2>Featured Work</h2>
        <h3>ðŸŒ± Plant Chromatin Biology Research</h3>
        <p>
            In my research, I focus on how introns impact chromatin features and gene regulation in plants. I aim to uncover how 
            these non-coding sequences contribute to broader epigenetic mechanisms.

        <h2>Outreach & Mentorship</h2>
        <p>
            I am deeply committed to fostering equitable and accessible spaces in STEM. As a Mexican immigrant, I have faced barriers on my path to 
            higher education, and I am passionate about creating opportunities for students from historically underrepresented groups.
